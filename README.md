If you are running from IDEs, then:
- Install the dependencies and packages first mentioned in the ```requirements.txt``` file

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Then run the ```downloader.py``` file.
  - In **Windows** , this can be done by running the command
    ```
    python downloader.py
    ```
  - In Linux, the same works by running (currently **NOT WORKING** on _Linux_)
    ```
    python3 downloader.py
    ```

Currently not in a proper state to run on Linux.

This has not been made into a proper application.
After it will be made into an executable, you can directly run by double clicking the **.exe** file.

Suggestions to improve the **_UI/UX and other functionalities_** will be appreciated.
