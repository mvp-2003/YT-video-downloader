If you are running from IDEs, then:
- Install the dependencies and packages first mentioned in the ```requirements.txt``` file

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Then run the ```downloader.py``` file
```
python downloader.py
```

This has not been made into a proper application.
After it will be made into an executable, you can directly run by double clicking the **.exe** file.

Suggestions to improve the **_UI/UX and other functionalities_** will be appreciated.
