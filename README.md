If you are running from IDEs / Power shell / Command Prompt, then:
- Install the dependencies and packages first mentioned in the ```requirements.txt``` file

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Then run the ```main.py``` file.
  - In **Windows** , this can be done by running the command
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
  - In Linux, the same works by running (currently **NOT WORKING** on _Linux_)
    ```
    python3 main.py
    ```
      Currently not in a proper state to run on Linux.

This has not been made into a proper application.

After it will be made into an executable, you can directly run by double clicking the **.exe** file.
Improve ideas for the **_UI/UX and other functionalities_** will be appreciated.

**SUGGESTED (for *developers*): Use *Virtual Environment*.**
